# Indeed-Analysis-Oct-2022-
Summary: Cleaning and analyzing scraped data from Indeed.com for Business Analyst, Data Analyst, and Data Scientist internships in October 2022. 

Background: I'm currently in graduate school studying Information Systems with a concentration in Business Analytics, and I work full-time for a music publishing company in Nashville, TN. I decided to complete this project in my free time. The project displays some skills I've learned over the last year in school and provides valuable insights about internship opportunities in the Business Analytics, Data Analytics, and Data Science fields.

Why: I'm currently seeking an internship opportunity. Trying to determine what's important to employers based on screening through hundreds of job postings on Indeed.com is challenging and time-consuming. What skills are required? Are there specific coding languages that employers want interns to be familiar with? How many internships are remote vs. in-person? I had many questions, so I scraped information from Indeed.com, cleaned the data, and created an interactive dashboard to understand it better.

Tools Used: Octoparse, Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Excel, Tableau 

When: The project officially began on 10/20/22, and I finished it on 12/28/22. 

How: I used Octoparse to scrape the data from Indeed.com. Information related to each type of internship (Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Data Scientist) was consolidated into its own Excel file. I then uploaded the data into a Jupyter Notebook file using Python's Pandas tool. I cleaned and reorganized the data from there. Once I had created a data frame consisting of all the information I thought would be helpful to showcase, I extracted the data frame into an Excel file which I connected to Tableau to create an interactive dashboard.

Challenges: I decided to use Octoparse to scrape the data from Indeed.com rather than build a web scraping program since this project aimed to showcase skills I've learned in Python and Tableau rather than web scraping. Also, building a web scraping program would have caused the project to exceed my estimated time for completion. The data collected from Indeed was helpful but messy and lacked specific columns of information that I would need to showcase my findings. Most of the heavy lifting related to cleaning the data was creating particular formats for each column of data since there was variation within each column. For example, each state had various versions within the location data. Outside of cleaning the data, I also wanted to create new columns highlighting information in the job description. Information such as whether the job posting mentioned Python, SQL, Machine Learning, etc. Even though the final Excel file I extracted from the Jupyter Notebook was easier to interpret, I still needed to create several calculated fields and adjust number formats in Tableau for the data to be shown in my desired format. 

Findings: Based on the information from Indeed.com between 10/20/22 - 10/22/22. A total of 1,415 internships related to Business Analytics, Data Analytics, and Data Science are available. Data Science consists of the majority of those at 718, followed by Data Analytics (400) and Business Analytics (297). Based on the distribution of the job postings that mentioned the highlighted skills, the most requested is Machine Learning (47.5%). However, since there was a greater number of Data Science opportunities, the information was skewed more toward skills mentioned related to those specific job postings. Looking at the tools mentioned in the job postings, SQL is the most requested of those mentioned (31%), followed by Excel and Python. When observing the location data, California is the state with the most significant number of in-person internships (167), followed by New York (98) and Texas (73). Lastly, in-person opportunities far outnumber remote and hybrid internships. It's important to note that the information related to the overall findings varies when diving into each specific type of internship. For example, while SQL is the most requested tool for interns to be familiar with when looking at the overall findings, Excel is by far the most mentioned when looking at Business Analyst positions, and communication is the highest mentioned skill. For Data Analyst positions, the most requested skill is Data Visualization, while the highest mentioned tool is SQL, followed by Excel. However, for Data Science opportunities, the skill with the highest number of mentions is machine learning, and the most popular tool mentioned in the data is Python.
